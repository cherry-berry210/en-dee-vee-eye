This readme file contains an overview of the project files and their usages.

"FourEstuaries_forCherry.csv"
This file is a cleaned dataset provided by Amy to help with the expanded analysis of all four estuaries. THANK YOU

"cordgrass_tings.xlsx"
A defunct Excel sheet from the original Newport Bay analysis. I tried to remove it from the GitHub website but it still shows up.

"four_ndvi_inc.xlsx"
The crown jewel of this project, this file contains the cleaned vegetation dataset combined with NDVI values for each transect replicate plot location (did I say that right?). Some minor cleaning was necessary, but it is noted within the .qmd.

"ndvi_analysis.qmd"
This is where the magic happened. This includes my original EDA, graphs and all. I marked all new, relevant sections pertaining to the focal project final and even numbered the steps I took. This mainly revolved around organizing the data, lmer, and glm functions.
